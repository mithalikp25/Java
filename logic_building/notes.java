//Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

// The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

// Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
// Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
// Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
// Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be null.
